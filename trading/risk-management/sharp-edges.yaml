  - id: risk-of-ruin
    summary: Taking position sizes that can blow up account
    severity: critical
    situation: Position size so large that a few consecutive losses would devastate account
    why: |
      Risk of ruin is the mathematical probability of losing everything.
      Even with 60% win rate, 10% risk per trade has >50% chance of ruin over time.
      "You can only go broke once."
    solution: |
      ## Risk of Ruin Prevention:
      
      | Risk Per Trade | Risk of Ruin (55% WR) |
      |----------------|----------------------|
      | 1%             | ~0%                  |
      | 2%             | ~1%                  |
      | 5%             | ~10%                 |
      | 10%            | ~50%                 |
      | 20%            | ~85%                 |
      
      RULE: Keep risk per trade at 1-2% maximum.
      Even with edge, variance can destroy you with large sizes.
    symptoms:
      - "I'll risk more on this great setup"
      - Position size > 5% of account
      - "I can't afford to lose this one"
    detection_pattern: "risk more|big position|can't afford to lose|sure thing"

  - id: correlation-blindness
    summary: Multiple positions in correlated assets appearing diversified
    severity: high
    situation: Holding BTC, ETH, SOL, and AVAX thinking it's "diversified"
    why: |
      Crypto assets are 70-90% correlated.
      When BTC dumps, everything dumps.
      "Diversification" within crypto is an illusion.
    solution: |
      ## Correlation Risk Check:
      
      HIGHLY CORRELATED (treat as one position):
      - All crypto (BTC, ETH, alts)
      - Tech stocks (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL)
      - All risk assets in risk-off events
      
      RULES:
      - Max 3% total risk in correlated bucket
      - If 1% BTC + 1% ETH = 2% crypto risk
      - Check correlation before adding position
    symptoms:
      - "I'm diversified in crypto"
      - 5+ altcoin positions simultaneously
      - "If BTC dumps, my alts might hold"
    detection_pattern: "diversified|spread across|different coins|hedge"

  - id: leverage-trap
    summary: Using leverage without understanding liquidation math
    severity: critical
    situation: 10x leverage on volatile assets
    why: |
      10x leverage means 10% move = 100% gain or loss.
      Liquidation often occurs BEFORE your stop loss.
      Funding rates and slippage eat into profits.
    solution: |
      ## Leverage Rules:
      
      | Asset Type | Max Leverage |
      |------------|--------------|
      | BTC        | 3x           |
      | ETH        | 2x           |
      | Altcoins   | 1x (no leverage) |
      | Stocks     | 2x           |
      
      LIQUIDATION BUFFER:
      Stop loss should be at least 50% of distance to liquidation
      
      EXAMPLE:
      10x long BTC at $90,000
      Liquidation: ~$81,000 (10% drop)
      Your stop: Should be above $85,500
    symptoms:
      - "I can handle high leverage"
      - "Just for this trade"
      - Stop loss near liquidation price
    detection_pattern: "10x|20x|high leverage|liquidation|margin call"

  - id: revenge-sizing
    summary: Increasing position size after losses to recover faster
    severity: critical
    situation: Lost 3 trades, now doubling size on 4th
    why: |
      Losses have affected your judgment.
      Larger size = larger potential loss.
      Recovery is already hard; don't make it harder.
    solution: |
      ## Post-Loss Protocol:
      
      After 3 consecutive losses:
      1. STOP trading for the day
      2. REDUCE next position by 50%
      3. REQUIRE extra confirmation on setups
      4. RETURN to normal size after 2 wins
      
      "If you're digging a hole, stop digging."
    symptoms:
      - "I need to make this back"
      - Increasing size after losses
      - Taking more trades than usual
    detection_pattern: "make back|recover|double size|bigger position"

  - id: unrealistic-expectations
    summary: Expecting consistent high returns without drawdowns
    severity: medium
    situation: Expecting 50%+ annual returns with minimal drawdown
    why: |
      Professional funds average 15-25% annually.
      Even the best traders have 20-30% drawdowns.
      High returns = high volatility = high drawdowns.
    solution: |
      ## Realistic Expectations:
      
      | Return Target | Typical Max DD | Realistic? |
      |---------------|----------------|------------|
      | 10%/year      | 5-10%          | Very       |
      | 20%/year      | 10-20%         | Yes        |
      | 50%/year      | 25-40%         | Possible   |
      | 100%/year     | 40-60%         | Rare/Risky |
      
      RULE: Max drawdown often = annual return target
    symptoms:
      - "I should be making 10% per month"
      - Frustration with "only" 30% annual
      - Comparing to outlier results on Twitter
    detection_pattern: "should be making|easy|guaranteed|every month"

  - id: stop-loss-placement-error
    summary: Placing stops at obvious levels that get hunted
    severity: high
    situation: Stop exactly at swing low where everyone else's stop is
    why: |
      Market makers hunt obvious stop levels.
      Round numbers attract stop clusters.
      Getting stopped out just before reversal is common.
    solution: |
      ## Smart Stop Placement:
      
      AVOID:
      - Exactly at swing low/high
      - Round numbers ($90,000, $100,000)
      - Obvious pattern invalidation
      
      BETTER:
      - 0.5-1% beyond the obvious level
      - Use ATR for buffer sizing
      - Give room for stop hunts
      
      EXAMPLE:
      Obvious stop: $90,000 (swing low)
      Better stop: $89,100 (1% below)
    symptoms:
      - Stopped out then price reverses
      - Stop exactly at round number
      - Multiple stops hit at same level
    detection_pattern: "exact low|round number|everyone's stop"

  - id: overtrading
    summary: Taking too many positions, diluting edge
    severity: medium
    situation: 20+ trades per week, no clear strategy
    why: |
      More trades = more fees and slippage.
      Quality setups are rare (2-4 per week for most).
      Overtrading usually indicates poor discipline.
    solution: |
      ## Trade Frequency Guidelines:
      
      | Style       | Trades/Week | Notes |
      |-------------|-------------|-------|
      | Position    | 1-2         | Hold days-weeks |
      | Swing       | 3-5         | Hold hours-days |
      | Day trade   | 10-20       | Close same day |
      
      QUALITY CHECK:
      - Does each trade meet ALL criteria?
      - Are you taking "B-grade" setups?
      - Could you explain each trade in 2 sentences?
    symptoms:
      - More than 5 trades/day (swing trader)
      - "I'll take this one too"
      - Multiple small losses daily
    detection_pattern: "just one more|might as well|take this too"

  - id: position-sizing-inconsistency
    summary: Random position sizes without methodology
    severity: high
    situation: 0.5% risk one trade, 5% the next, based on "feel"
    why: |
      Inconsistent sizing destroys statistical edge.
      Big losses on random large positions hurt average.
      Makes it impossible to evaluate strategy.
    solution: |
      ## Consistent Sizing Protocol:
      
      1. DEFINE standard risk (1% recommended)
      2. CALCULATE every position using formula
      3. DOCUMENT sizes in trade journal
      4. REVIEW monthly for consistency
      
      EXCEPTIONS (only):
      - Reduced size: Low conviction, high volatility
      - Never increased size based on "feel"
    symptoms:
      - "I'll size up on this one"
      - Different % risk each trade
      - Gut-feel position sizing
    detection_pattern: "size up|bigger on this|feels right|go large"
