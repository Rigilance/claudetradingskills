    summary: Treating pivot dates as guaranteed reversals
    severity: critical
    situation: Entering large positions because "it's a pivot day"
    why: |
      Pivot dates indicate increased probability, not certainty.
      Roughly 60-70% of pivots see "significant" moves.
      But 30-40% will be false signals or noise.
      Treating pivots as certainties leads to overconfidence and losses.
    solution: |
      ## Pivot Reality Check:
      
      | What Pivots Tell You | What Pivots DON'T Tell You |
      |---------------------|---------------------------|
      | When to pay attention | Direction of move |
      | Probability shift | Magnitude of move |
      | Time of potential change | Whether it will happen |
      
      PROTOCOL:
      1. Pivot = attention point
      2. Wait for price action confirmation
      3. Enter only with technical trigger
      4. Accept some pivots will be noise
    symptoms:
      - "The pivot says we reverse today"
      - Large position on pivot day without confirmation
      - "IKAGI is never wrong"
    detection_pattern: "guaranteed|certain|will reverse|must turn"

  - id: early-entry-before-pivot
    summary: Entering before pivot date to "get better price"
    severity: high
    situation: Taking position 2-3 days before pivot anticipating reversal
    why: |
      Trend can continue through pivot without reversing.
      Early entry means stop might get hit before pivot arrives.
      Price might not reach your anticipated level.
    solution: |
      ## Timing Protocol:
      
      WRONG:
      - Enter 3 days before pivot
      - "I'll get in early for better price"
      
      RIGHT:
      - Wait until pivot window (±1 day)
      - Require price confirmation
      - Accept potentially worse price for higher probability
      
      "It's better to miss the bottom and confirm the turn
       than catch the bottom and be wrong."
    symptoms:
      - Position entered days before pivot
      - "I want to be ahead of the turn"
      - No price confirmation required
    detection_pattern: "get in early|better price|ahead of|anticipate"

  - id: ignoring-failed-pivot
    summary: Refusing to accept when pivot doesn't produce expected result
    severity: high
    situation: Pivot day passes, no reversal, but still holding onto thesis
    why: |
      Not every pivot produces a reversal.
      Holding failed thesis leads to larger losses.
      Markets don't care about your analysis.
    solution: |
      ## Failed Pivot Protocol:
      
      After pivot day + 1:
      1. Did price confirm your thesis? (Y/N)
      2. If NO: Thesis is invalidated
      3. If invalidated: Exit or stop out
      4. Do NOT extend "just give it one more day"
      
      Pivot window is 2 days. After that, move on.
    symptoms:
      - "The pivot just needs more time"
      - Extending thesis past pivot window
      - Moving stops to avoid being wrong
    detection_pattern: "needs more time|just wait|will still happen"

  - id: over-reliance-on-historical-accuracy
    summary: Expecting future pivots to match historical accuracy
    severity: medium
    situation: "Last 5 pivots worked, so this one will too"
    why: |
      Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
      Market conditions change.
      Sample size of pivots is often small.
    solution: |
      ## Historical Data Usage:
      
      USE historical accuracy for:
      - Informing position size (not conviction)
      - Understanding typical magnitude
      - Setting realistic expectations
      
      DON'T USE for:
      - "Guaranteeing" this pivot will work
      - Increasing position size
      - Skipping price confirmation
    symptoms:
      - "Last 5 worked, this one will too"
      - Oversized position due to track record
      - Skipping confirmation "because IKAGI"
    detection_pattern: "track record|always works|never fails"

  - id: missing-price-level-context
    summary: Trading pivots without reference to key price levels
    severity: high
    situation: Only using time, ignoring where price is
    why: |
      Best pivot trades have confluence:
      TIME (pivot) + PRICE (key level) + VOLUME
      Time alone is insufficient.
      Price level provides confirmation and stop placement.
    solution: |
      ## Pivot + Price Framework:
      
      Before pivot trade:
      - [ ] Key support/resistance identified
      - [ ] Price is AT or NEAR key level
      - [ ] Stop loss has structural basis
      - [ ] Volume pattern noted
      
      If price is in "no man's land" at pivot:
      - Lower probability setup
      - Reduce size or skip
    symptoms:
      - "It's pivot day, I'll trade"
      - No price levels defined
      - Stop not based on structure
    detection_pattern: "just because pivot|time-only|don't care about price"

  - id: pivot-clustering-confusion
    summary: Not properly handling multiple nearby pivots
    severity: medium
    situation: Two pivots 2 days apart, treating each independently
    why: |
      Clustered pivots should be treated as a zone, not separate events.
      Extended volatility period expected.
      May see whipsaw between pivots.
    solution: |
      ## Cluster Protocol:
      
      When 2+ pivots within 3 days:
      1. Treat as SINGLE event window
      2. Reduce size more aggressively
      3. Widen stops for whipsaw
      4. Wait for cluster to complete
      5. Confirm direction AFTER last pivot
      
      Don't trade the first pivot expecting the second to confirm it.
    symptoms:
      - "First pivot long, second pivot I'll add"
      - Trading each pivot as separate signal
      - Not waiting for cluster completion
    detection_pattern: "first pivot|each pivot|add on second"

  - id: different-asset-pivot-confusion
    summary: Applying one asset's pivot to another
    severity: medium
    situation: BTC has pivot, trading ETH expecting same behavior
    why: |
      Pivots are asset-specific calculations.
      BTC pivot doesn't mean ETH will behave same way.
      Correlation exists but isn't 1:1.
    solution: |
      ## Multi-Asset Pivot Rules:
      
      BTC pivot exists:
      - Trade BTC directly if want pivot exposure
      - ETH/alts may follow but not guaranteed
      - Don't assume alt pivot timing matches BTC
      
      If trading alt around BTC pivot:
      - Acknowledge higher uncertainty
      - Reduce size further
      - Focus on BTC confirmation first
    symptoms:
      - "BTC pivot means ETH will reverse"
      - Trading alt using BTC pivot timing
      - Ignoring asset-specific pivots
    detection_pattern: "BTC pivot so ETH|same for all|crypto pivot"

  - id: news-override-denial
    summary: Expecting pivot to work despite major news event
    severity: high
    situation: CPI release on pivot day, expecting pivot to dominate
    why: |
      Major news events can override pivot signals.
      News creates immediate price action, pivots are probabilistic.
      Better to wait for news dust to settle.
    solution: |
      ## News + Pivot Conflict:
      
      If major news on or near pivot day:
      1. News impact comes first (hours)
      2. Pivot impact comes second (days)
      3. Wait for news reaction to settle
      4. Then assess if pivot signal is valid
      
      High-impact events that override:
      - FOMC decisions
      - CPI/PPI releases
      - Major geopolitical events
      - Black swan events
    symptoms:
      - "Pivot will beat CPI"
      - Ignoring scheduled news
      - Not adjusting for event risk
    detection_pattern: "pivot more important|ignore news|doesn't matter"
