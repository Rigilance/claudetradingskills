  - id: trading-against-trend
    summary: Fighting the dominant trend
    severity: high
    situation: Taking counter-trend trades in strong momentum
    why: |
      Counter-trend trades have significantly lower probability of success.
      Strong trends can persist far longer than logic suggests.
      "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."
    solution: |
      ## Before Counter-Trend Trades, Verify:
      
      | Checklist | Yes/No |
      |-----------|--------|
      | Clear divergence on 2+ timeframes? | _____ |
      | Price at major structural level? | _____ |
      | Volume showing exhaustion? | _____ |
      | Multiple timeframe confluence? | _____ |
      | Reduced position size? | _____ |
      
      If less than 4 "Yes" answers, WAIT for trend weakness confirmation.
    symptoms:
      - "I think this is oversold"
      - "It can't go higher/lower"
      - Multiple stop-outs in same direction
      - "This is a great level to fade"
    detection_pattern: "oversold|overbought|can't go|due for|has to reverse"

  - id: revenge-trading
    summary: Trading to recover losses emotionally
    severity: critical
    situation: After a losing trade, immediately entering another without proper analysis
    why: |
      Emotional decisions override rational analysis.
      Increased position size to "make it back" amplifies losses.
      Revenge trading is the #1 account killer.
    solution: |
      ## After a Loss:
      
      1. STOP - Walk away for at least 15 minutes
      2. JOURNAL - Write what went wrong
      3. CHECK - Does next trade meet ALL criteria?
      4. SIZE - Use normal or reduced size, never increased
      
      If you feel "I need to make this back":
      - You are NOT in trading mindset
      - Close the charts
      - Return tomorrow
    symptoms:
      - "I need to make this back"
      - Immediate entry after stop hit
      - Increasing position size after loss
      - Skipping setup checklist
    detection_pattern: "make back|recover|double down|increase size after"

  - id: fomo-entries
    summary: Entering after significant price move
    severity: high
    situation: Buying because price is going up rapidly without proper setup
    why: |
      Late entries have poor risk/reward.
      You're likely buying from earlier traders taking profit.
      FOMO leads to buying tops and selling bottoms.
    solution: |
      ## FOMO Checklist:
      
      - Did this move happen without you? Accept it.
      - Is there a clear pullback entry available? Wait for it.
      - What's the risk/reward from HERE? Calculate honestly.
      - Would you take this setup if you just opened the chart?
      
      "The best trades feel boring at entry."
    symptoms:
      - "It's running without me"
      - "I'll just get in now"
      - No clear stop loss level
      - Entry at daily high/low
    detection_pattern: "running|missing out|FOMO|just get in|don't miss"

  - id: analysis-paralysis
    summary: Over-analyzing and missing opportunities
    severity: medium
    situation: Spending hours on analysis without taking action
    why: |
      Perfect setups don't exist.
      More indicators often means more confusion.
      The market won't wait for your analysis to be complete.
    solution: |
      ## Combat Analysis Paralysis:
      
      1. SET TIME LIMIT: Max 15 minutes per asset
      2. USE CHECKLIST: 5 criteria max, must meet 4
      3. DECIDE: In or out, no "maybes"
      4. EXECUTE: Once decided, act within 1 hour
      
      If you can't decide in 15 minutes, the setup isn't clear enough.
    symptoms:
      - "Let me check one more indicator"
      - Multiple tabs open for same asset
      - Analysis time > 30 minutes per setup
      - "I need more confirmation"
    detection_pattern: "one more|not sure|need more|let me check"

  - id: ignoring-invalidation
    summary: Holding losers past invalidation point
    severity: critical
    situation: Moving stop loss or ignoring when price invalidates thesis
    why: |
      Small losses become large losses.
      Invalidation exists for a reason - your thesis was wrong.
      Hope is not a trading strategy.
    solution: |
      ## Invalidation Rules:
      
      1. Define invalidation BEFORE entry (written)
      2. Never move stop further from entry
      3. If invalidated, exit. No exceptions.
      4. Journal why thesis was wrong
      
      "The first loss is the best loss."
    symptoms:
      - "I'll give it more room"
      - Moving stop loss down/up
      - "It will come back"
      - Averaging down on losers
    detection_pattern: "give it room|will come back|average down|move stop"

  - id: overconfidence-after-wins
    summary: Increasing risk after winning streak
    severity: high
    situation: Feeling invincible after several winning trades
    why: |
      Winning streaks are often followed by mean reversion.
      Increased confidence leads to larger position sizes.
      One oversize loss can wipe out multiple small wins.
    solution: |
      ## After Winning Streak:
      
      1. MAINTAIN standard position sizes
      2. REVIEW: Were wins skill or luck?
      3. EXPECT mean reversion (mentally prepare)
      4. TIGHTEN criteria - be more selective, not less
    symptoms:
      - "I can't lose"
      - Increasing position sizes
      - Taking "B-grade" setups
      - Reducing analysis time
    detection_pattern: "can't lose|on fire|increase size|easy money"

  - id: weekend-analysis-bias
    summary: Forming strong opinions during weekend when markets are closed
    severity: medium
    situation: Building conviction on direction when you can't test hypothesis
    why: |
      Weekend gaps can invalidate weekend analysis.
      News over weekend changes everything.
      Crypto trades 24/7 but liquidity is lower.
    solution: |
      ## Weekend Analysis Rules:
      
      1. USE weekends for strategy review, not conviction building
      2. WAIT for Monday/Sunday night price action
      3. MARK key levels, don't predict direction
      4. PREPARE for multiple scenarios, not one
    symptoms:
      - Strong directional conviction formed Saturday
      - Limit orders set before Sunday open
      - "Monday will definitely..."
    detection_pattern: "definitely|100%|will gap|Monday direction"

  - id: news-trading-failure
    summary: Trading news events without edge
    severity: high
    situation: Trying to predict market reaction to news
    why: |
      News reaction is often opposite of logical expectation.
      Algos and institutions have faster execution.
      Slippage destroys retail edge on news.
    solution: |
      ## News Trading Protocol:
      
      1. REDUCE size before known events (FOMC, CPI)
      2. WAIT 15-30 minutes after news for dust to settle
      3. TRADE the reaction, not the news
      4. ACCEPT that sitting out is valid
      
      "Don't trade the news, trade the chart after the news."
    symptoms:
      - Guessing CPI/FOMC direction
      - Position before news without hedge
      - "Good news = price up"
    detection_pattern: "CPI will|FOMC will|news means|should gap"
